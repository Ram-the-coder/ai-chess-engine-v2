# About
Consists of a chess engine that uses AI searching algorithms to find the best move. The chess engine is written in javascript from scratch. The engine is connected to a chessboard so that one can play against it. Though it is nowhere as powerful or as fast as the popular stockfish (the 2nd most powerful chess engine), it still can play well enough to beat a novice easily.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
